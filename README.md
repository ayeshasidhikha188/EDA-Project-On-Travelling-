EDA Project: Travel Experience Analysis
Introduction
This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand various aspects of customers' travel preferences, spending behaviors, and satisfaction levels. By segmenting customers based on their travel experiences, we aim to uncover insights that can inform marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer satisfaction initiatives.
